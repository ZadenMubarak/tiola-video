# The Livepeer x Tiola video-sharing app

Summary:

This video-sharing Dapp is a decentralized application that allows users to share and stream video content in a decentralized manner. The Dapp utilizes the power of blockchain technology and peer-to-peer networks to create a platform that is fast, secure, and censorship-resistant.
The Dapp uses LivePeer and XMTP chat as its underlying technology. LivePeer is a decentralized video transcoding and streaming platform that uses a network of nodes to process and deliver video content. This ensures that videos are delivered in a high-quality and consistent manner, regardless of the device or location of the viewer.
XMTP chat is a decentralized messaging protocol that enables secure and private communication between users. It allows users to send messages, files, and multimedia content in a decentralized manner, ensuring that their communication is not monitored or censored by third parties.
Together, LivePeer and XMTP chat provide the Dapp with a scalable and decentralized infrastructure for video sharing and communication. Users can share and stream videos with confidence, knowing that their content is secure and cannot be censored or manipulated by centralized entities.
